      <h4>Improver</h4>
      <p><b>Location: Cph4water, Valdemarsgade 12, 1665 Copenhagen.</b></p>
  <p>
This class is organised in cooperation with Cph4water and takes place at Idrætsfabrikken, all five Sundays in March. All profits are donated to WaterAid.
    </p>
  <p>
We cover everything you need to move up to intermediate: cross-body leads, left and right turns (LA-style), connection, and technique. Each week has a different focus, but the key concepts are revisited throughout, so you can skip a week without falling behind. We also emphasise leading and following over memorising patterns — so you can take what you learn straight to social dancing.

<p>Experience required: see below for the improver requirements. For Cph4water students, this means having taken previously Salsa 3 or Salsa 4.</p>

  <h4>Intermediate</h4>
  <p><b>Location: Inflow studio: Heimdalsgade 35, 2nd Floor, 2200 Copenhagen.</b></p>


    <p><strong>Intermediate 1</strong>
The class covers covering inside and outside turns, double turns, and 360. We focus on connection and technique, making sure that followers don't predict the patterns during the class, so that we can easily apply what we learned to social dances.
        </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate 2</strong> This class builds on the material of Intermediate 1. We learn additional combinations and put even more effort on technique and body positioning so that the combinations work effortless with faster music. It also includes some practice time to keep up the repertoire from previous sessions.
</p>
  <p><strong>Take both intermediate classes together:</strong> Intermediate 2 builds on Intermediate 1 each week. Contact us before signing up for Intermediate 2 only.</p>
