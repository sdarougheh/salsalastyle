  <p><strong>Take both classes:</strong> Intermediate 2 builds on Intermediate 1 each week. Contact us before signing up for Intermediate 2 only.</p>

    <p><strong>Intermediate 1</strong>
The class covers covering inside and outside turns, double turns, and 360. We focus on connection and technique, making sure that followers don't predict the patterns during the class, so that we can easily apply what we learned to social dances.
        </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate 2</strong> This class builds on the material of Intermediate 1. We learn additional combinations and put even more effort on technique and body positioning so that the combinations work effortless with faster music. It also includes some practice time to keep up the repertoire from previous sessions.
