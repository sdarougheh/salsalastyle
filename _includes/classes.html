      <h4>Improver</h4>
      <p><b>Location: cph4water, Valdemarsgade 12, 1665 Copenhagen.</b></p>
  <p>
    The class is organised in cooperation with Cph4water and takes place all Sundays in March at Idrætsfabrikken.
    All profits from this class will be donated to WaterAid.
    You can sign up in advance on our website for a 20% discount (one free class!), or pay on the spot for drop-in.
        The class will cover all necessary improver content to move up to intermediate: for example cross-body leads, and left and right turns (LA-style)!
    The different classes will repeat the key concepts but have different focus each week, so that it's recommended to take them all, but you can also skip some without being lost later.
    We will also work on connection and technique, making sure that followers don't predict the patterns during the class, so that we can easily apply what we learned to social dances.
  Experience requirement: see below. 4water students: we recommend this class if you are in the levels Salsa 3 or Salsa 4.
      </p>
  <h4>Intermediate</h4>
  <p><b>Location: Inflow studio: Heimdalsgade 35, 2nd Floor, 2200 Copenhagen.</b></p>


    <p><strong>Intermediate 1</strong>
The class covers covering inside and outside turns, double turns, and 360. We focus on connection and technique, making sure that followers don't predict the patterns during the class, so that we can easily apply what we learned to social dances.
        </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate 2</strong> This class builds on the material of Intermediate 1. We learn additional combinations and put even more effort on technique and body positioning so that the combinations work effortless with faster music. It also includes some practice time to keep up the repertoire from previous sessions.
</p>
  <p><strong>Take both intermediate classes together:</strong> Intermediate 2 builds on Intermediate 1 each week. Contact us before signing up for Intermediate 2 only.</p>
